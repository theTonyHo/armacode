Tables
======

    Tables are useful in the production of drawings to display data.

Introducing Tables in Rhinoceros
--------------------------------

Rhinoceros 5 is not capable of generating a table (as of 24/10/2014). The following set of tools have been created to allow users to create, and manage tables in Rhinoceros 5.

Through the production of drawings, tables are useful to display quantity take off and other data related to the drawing.

Table can also be used to display the drawing register which is managed by an Excel spreadsheet.

Requirements
------------

* Microsoft Excel 2013
* armacode


Design & Concept
----------------

* Table is designed and created using Line, Text and Hatch objects.
* Each Cell value is represented by a Text Object.
* Row border is represented by a Rectangle
* Row fill is represented by a Hatch. Alternating rows are on different layers for Banded Rows formatting.
* Table geometries are stored in a Block Definition.
* Table name has a prefix "_TABLE_"
* Table properties, including the data values itself, are stored in Block Description

BrepBooleanDifference
---------------------
Perform Brep Boolean Difference on a set of polysurfaces using a set of cutters.

The built-in Rhino command `BooleanDifference` does not seem to work properly with multiple cutters.
This tool iterates through each Brep and each cutter and perform BooleanDifference.

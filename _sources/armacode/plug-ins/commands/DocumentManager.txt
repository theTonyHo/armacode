Document Manager can be used in the following scenarios:

1. The user can use the RDM workbook to quickly manipulate the properties of the Rhino document. (Non=Associated Link)
2. The user can use the RDM to manage quanity of objects and also drawing register.(Associated Link)

Read from Rhino document to Excel file.
Save the workbook to the temporary folder.

If the user wants to maintain the association between the workbook and the Rhino document,
the workbook needs to be saved to a more permanent location, preferrably
the same folder as the Rhino document:

For Example:

    Model_3D.3dm
    Model_3D_RDM.xlsx

Working with unassociated workbooks, best practice is to close the Rhino Document Manager workbook after update

RDM Open the workbook in this order, :

    Associated workbook
    Active workbook with title "Rhino Document Manager"
    armacode Excel Template.

Association link will only be created on Update.
Association link will NOT be created if the Excel file is located in the temporary folder

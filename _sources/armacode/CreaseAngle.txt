CreaseAngle
-----------
Calculate the crease angle between two surfaces. The angle segment is determined by the surface normal.

:param srfA: Surface A
:param srfB: Surface B

                      If set to True, return the angle segment on the surface normal first.
                      If set to False, return the smallest angle first

:returns: Common Edge Curve ID, Angle and its Reflex Angle.

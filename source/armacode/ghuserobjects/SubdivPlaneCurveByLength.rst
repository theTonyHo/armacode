--------------------------------

Populate a 2-Segmented Polyline, whose first segment represents the x-Axis, the second the y-Axis with Planes based on Subdivision by Length.
The Base Curve for the Subdivision can either be the first or the Second Segment of the input Curve.
EndDist means the Distance to the each end of the Curve before equal subdivision starts happening.

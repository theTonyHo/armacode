Minimum Bounding Box 2D |icon| 
-----------------------

Calculates and returns a minimum Bounding Box for a set of geometries

Criteria
0 - Area (default)
1 - Volume
2 - X dimension
3 - Y dimension
4 - Shortest Dimension

Extra Planes:
Planes that are aligned to the naked edges of the geometry. By definition, if the geometry has straight edges, the minimum boundingBox is aligned to one of those edges

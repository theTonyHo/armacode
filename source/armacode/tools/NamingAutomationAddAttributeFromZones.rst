NamingAutomationAddAttributeFromZones
-------------------------------------
Add Attribute to objects from Zones

If an object is found inside a Zone, a closed Polysurface, it will inherit properties of that zone.
Toggle the properties to process, i.e. NameCopy and AttributesCopy
Zone can be named AA:XXX where AA contained objects will be set UserText attribute with key AA and value XXX. (to be depreciated)

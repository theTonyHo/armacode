Update Details from Boundary Curves
Boundary Curves are useful for visualising the detail view and also to re-focus the detail view.

The curve object must have Layout and Detail information to link to the detail.

Layout association:
Name of the boundary curve must be the same as the Layout Name

Detail association:
Layer of the Boundary Curve must be on the same Layer of the Detail View.

For layouts with only one detail. Layer matching is not necessary.

Curve is skipped if Layout does not exist.

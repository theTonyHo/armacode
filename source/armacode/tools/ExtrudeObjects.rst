Extrude Objects

Extrude planar curves and surfaces.
User to enter distance to extrude, this represents the thickness of the material.
If Bothside is turned on, the input geometry is assumed to be modelled as the center profile. The resultant extrusion is centered on this profile. Again, distance represent the total thickness of the result geometry.

Classes
=======

    Classes are predefined objects which can be used in future projects for Research, and possibly Production, purposes.

Each class should be in their own ClassBase folder. For example, Particle, MovingParticle, FlockingParticle would be part of the ParticleSystem Class.

Access the classes with the following::

    import armacode
    p = armacode.classes.ParticleSystem.Particle()
